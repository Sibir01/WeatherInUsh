# WeatherInUsh
This is a project for getting weather data with the ability to save this data to a database
In the project, I used JavaFX to create the visual part. MySQL was used as the database

How the project works:

When you start the program, it asks you to log in, but since you are not a registered user, you will have to register.
After that, your data will be saved to the database and in the future you can easily enter the application.

Now you can enter the city you are interested in and the application will send an API request to the site with weather data and return your request.
You will be able to save this data to the database.
In the future, I plan to implement the ability to call the weather data that you have stored inside the application.
So that you can find out what the weather was like on a particular day when you saved the data
